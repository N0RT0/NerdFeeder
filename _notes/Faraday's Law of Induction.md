$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E}=\frac{ \partial \mathbf{B} }{ \partial t } 
$$

$$
\displaystyle\oint_{\text{loop}}E\cdot d\mathbf{l}=- \frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}
$$

A changing magnetic flux through a loop induces an electric field along the loop.  
This is the principle behind generators. Moving a magnet near a coil changes the magnetic flux, producing an electric current.
