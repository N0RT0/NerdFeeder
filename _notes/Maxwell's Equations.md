[[Gauss's Law for Electricity]]
The electric flux out of a closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed. Electric charges are sources (positive) or sinks (negative) of electric fields.

Gauss's Law for Magnitism
The net magnetic flux out of a closed surface is always zero. There are no magnetic monopoles. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.

Faraday's Law of Induction
A time-varying magnetic field induces a circulating electric field.  
Changing magnetic fields create electric fields (basis of electric generators).

Ampère–Maxwell Law
Magnetic fields are generated by electric currents and by changing electric fields.  
Electric currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields (basis of electromagnets and radio waves).
