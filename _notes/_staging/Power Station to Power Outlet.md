## Introduction
Having electricity in the home  is a necessity of society. It is almost hard to imagine what it would be like to go one week without easy access to electrical power. Here, we will deep dive into what electrical power delivery looked like in its infancy in both the United States and Europe. Additionally, the evolution of power delivery will be investigated to nourish an understanding on how we got to the point of most homes in the U.S. and Europe having cheap and easy access to electricity.

I am going to do my best to elaborate on engineering related details, but if that is not your cup of tea, feel free to skip over it. You will still get a pretty good story on how we got to where we are today.
