title: Gauss's Law for Electricity
---


$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}=\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_{0}}
$$

$$
\displaystyle\oint_{\text{surface}}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}=\frac{Q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\varepsilon_{0}}
$$

The total electric flux through any closed surface equals the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity of free space. 

Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges. The more charge inside, the more field lines pass through the surface.
